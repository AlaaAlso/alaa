          Born in Aimorés, Brazil, Sebastião Salgado trained as an economist
          before becoming a photographer in the early 1970s. He earned an MA in
          economics from São Paulo University in 1968 and a PhD in economics
          from the University of Paris in 1971. His work at the International
          Coffee Organization in London required him to make frequent trips to
          Africa, and his desire to document these experiences sparked his
          interest in photography; by 1974 he was freelancing as a
          photojournalist for the Sygma agency in Paris. He then worked for
          Gamma from 1975 until 1979, when he joined Magnum, the international
          photography cooperative founded in 1947 by Henri Cartier-Bresson,
          Robert Capa, George Rodger and Chim (David Seymour). Salgado has
          produced a number of extended documentary series throughout his
          career, several of which have been published. These include Sahel:
          L'homme en détresse (1986), Other Americas (1986), An Uncertain Grace
          (1990), and Workers (1993), a worldwide investigation of the
          increasing obsolescence of manual labor. Salgado has won many honors
          for his work, among them the Eugene Smith Award for Humanitarian
          Photography, two ICP Infinity Awards for Journalism, the Erna and
          Victor Hasselblad Award, and the Arles

          International Festival's prize for best photography book of the year
          for Workers. Sebastião Salgado's straightforward photographs portray
          individuals living in desperate economic circumstances. Because he
          insists on presenting his pictures in series, rather than
          individually, and because each work's point of view refuses to
          separate subject from context, Salgado achieves a difficult task. His
          photographs impart the dignity and integrity of his subjects without
          forcing their heroism or implicitly soliciting pity, as many other
          photographs from the Third World do. Salgado's photography
          communicates a subtle understanding of social and economic situations
          that is seldom available in other photographers' representations of
          similar themes. Lisa Hostetler Handy et al. Reflections in a Glass
